# Sewak App

### Abstract
The healthcare sector is at the epicenter of this unprecedented global pandemic challenge, with rising number of cases finding a bed in a hospital has become a challenge of its own, due to the lack of a unified platform which links the data of all the hospitals in a geographic area and helps to overpass the hustle of finding a hospital with available beds and with the right set of required facilities.
Also, there is a lack of transparency in the current system for a patient looking out for a hospital and it leads to problems at patients end.
Thus as a counter to that we present to you Sewak a two-way system between a user and health provider. The solution we have developed is a web application named Sewak App, which can be used as a single platform for all health related queries.

### Description
Our solution is a two-way system between a user and health provider.The solution that weâ€™ll develop is a web application named Sewak App, which leverages information from a patient questionnaire regarding COVID-19-related symptoms and up-to-date information from medical centers to provide optimized medical center suggestions to patients for their needs.
Our platform can provide support by medical centers around the country, they will be able to provide critical up-to-date information such as: number of COVID-19 tests, number of available ventilators, PPE status, number of COVID-19 patients, type of medical facility(full care, testing only, non-COVID only) to help further guide our algorithm on matching patients with the correct hospitals. Furthermore, we hope to make this data accessible to all medical institutions accessing our database.

1. `npm install`
2. `cd client && npm install`
